---- Modify Mean_v04 and produce graphs of energy loss ----

Include graphs inside "EnergyDist" class.

***
In "EnergyDist.h":
- define a "BraggCurve" struct to hold pointers to a "BraggStatistic" and a
  "TH1F" object,
- modify the STL array to hold pointers to "BraggCurve" objects,
- declare a function "bCreate" to create a "BraggCurve" object 
  for different total energy ranges.

***
In "EnergyDist.cc":
- implement the function "bCreate" taking 3 arguments, one index and min-max
  energies; use the index to create the name for "TH1F" and min-max energies 
  to create the "BraggStatistic" object; store the pointers of the objects;
- in "beginJob" replace the direct creation of "BraggStatistic" object with 
  calls to "bCreate" for the 3 energy ranges and background,
- in "endJob" loop over the BraggCurve objects and for each one 
  get the mean and rms energies and use them to set center and error 
  values in TH1F by looping over points and using SetBinContent 
  and SetBinError; save each graph to file after setting the content,
- in "process" loop over the BraggCurve objects and call the 
  "add" function for each "BraggStatistic" object.
